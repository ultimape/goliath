# About

***This is a work in progress.***

It is intended to be a tool to get a more complete export of your twitter archive.

From what I can tell, Twitter released the archive functionality [back in 2012](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2012/your-twitter-archive.html) and it hasn't really been updated since. A number of outstanding deficiencies still exist, many outlined in this blog [post from 2013](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2013/02/deficiencies-in-the-twitter-archive/) a mere ~3 months after the feature rollout.

As a number of people are seeking to leave this platform for greener pastures (myself included), this completely broken archive system is *unacceptable*. I seek to fix that.

**Problems with the Archive Include, but are not limited to:**
* Images are not part of the archive, but are still stored on twitter's image hosting service.
* If you delete the original tweet off of Twitter, the associated images are also removed.
* You are unable to view tweets as threads, even your own.
* You are unable to view replies, even your own.
* You are unable to view 
* Quotetweets aren't captured as part of the archive at all.
* Search functionality is severely limited.
